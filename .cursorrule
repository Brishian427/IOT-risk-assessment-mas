# Project Standards
- Use Python 3.11+.
- Use Pydantic V2 for all data models (strictly typed JSON).
- Use 'LangGraph' for state management (since this is a cyclic workflow).
- All Agents must be defined as graph nodes.
- Docstrings should explain the "Reasoning Trace" requirement.

# Specific Architecture Rules
- The "Reasoning Trace" is as important as the score. Never discard text; synthesize it.
- Challenger B must always use a search tool to validate facts.
