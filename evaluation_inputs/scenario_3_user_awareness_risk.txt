Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: User Awareness Risk

Scenario Description:
Consumers treat IoT devices as 'install-and-forget' appliances. There is a disconnect between user expectations and the technical reality of maintenance (passwords/updates) and legal obligations (privacy laws).

Risk Mechanism:
Operational Negligence & Legal Liability: Users fail to change default passwords, enabling botnets. Users also unknowingly violate data protection laws by recording public spaces, leading to lawsuits.

Context Data:
- In 'Fairhurst v Woodard', a Ring doorbell user faced £100k potential damages for violating neighbors' privacy due to ignorance of the law
- UK smart meter adoption faces 'absolute disinterest'
- Parents in the S.C. baby monitor hack admitted security risks were 'not common knowledge'

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: How prevalent is user negligence/apathy? (Is it the norm?) 2) IMPACT: What are the legal (fines) and systemic consequences?
