Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: Cloud Dependency

Scenario Description:
Devices are designed to rely entirely on manufacturer cloud servers for core functionality. They lack local operation capabilities, making them vulnerable to vendor failures.

Risk Mechanism:
Service Failure & Trust Erosion: Outages, backend glitches, or vendor bankruptcy can 'brick' expensive hardware. Centralization also means user data must traverse third-party servers.

Context Data:
- Ring's backend glitch (May 2025) caused mass panic by incorrectly displaying 'unauthorized logins'
- UK Smart Meter rollouts faced multi-million pound fines (E.on, British Gas) due to centralized data delays
- iRobot data was sent to third-party labelers in Venezuela

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: Do cloud outages or glitches occur? 2) IMPACT: What is the consequence of losing essential home infrastructure (heating/monitoring)?
