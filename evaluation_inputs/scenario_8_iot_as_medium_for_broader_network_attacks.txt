Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: IoT as Medium for Broader Network Attacks

Scenario Description:
Compromised IoT devices are rarely the final target; they are used as entry points ('pivot points') to attack the home network or recruited into botnets to attack others.

Risk Mechanism:
Lateral Movement & Botnets: Weak IoT devices allow hackers to bypass the firewall and attack PCs/NAS drives. Collectively, they are weaponized for DDoS attacks against national infrastructure.

Context Data:
- The Mirai Botnet enslaved 600,000 IoT devices to disrupt global internet services (DNS)
- Hacked baby monitors provide a bridge to steal financial data from home computers
- 100,000 smart fridges were used to send spam

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: How automated/widespread are these botnet recruitments? 2) IMPACT: What is the societal damage (grid/internet) and local network damage?
