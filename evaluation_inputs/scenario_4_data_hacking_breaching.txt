Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: Data Hacking & Breaching

Scenario Description:
Manufacturers often prioritize ease-of-use over security, leading to unencrypted transmission or unsecured cloud databases. Devices store sensitive credentials (WiFi passwords, API tokens) that are targeted by hackers.

Risk Mechanism:
Cascading Exposure: Attackers exploit weak architecture to steal massive datasets. Stolen credentials are used for 'credential stuffing' to access banking or corporate accounts.

Context Data:
- Mars Hydro exposed 2.7 billion records including plaintext WiFi passwords
- 98% of IoT devices transmit data without encryption
- Smart refrigerators have been hacked to send spam emails

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: Are these vulnerabilities widespread in the industry? 2) IMPACT: What is the financial and identity theft impact of massive data leaks?
