Lifecycle Stage: End-of-Life (EOL)
Risk Category: Environmental Toxicity & Public Health

Scenario Description:
A significant portion of IoT waste ends up in landfills due to recycling complexity. These devices contain valuable but toxic metals (copper, indium, gallium) and plastics with Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs).

Risk Mechanism:
Toxic materials leach into soil and groundwater. Microplastics and BFRs enter the food chain (e.g., ingested by marine life like mussels/oysters), causing bio-accumulation. BFRs are linked to reproductive and hormonal disruption in humans.

Context Data:
- 30% of e-waste plastics contain BFRs
- 960 marine species have ingested microplastics
- Indium and gallium alter soil chemistry, affecting crop (rice) nutrient uptake
- 40% unaccounted WEEE gap indicates massive scale of contamination

Task:
Evaluate the Risk Score (Frequency x Impact). For 'Frequency/Likelihood', ask yourself: 'Is this risk state a constant feature of the device, a widespread vulnerability, or a rare targeted attack?' Note that while the impact is delayed (long-term health/ecosystem damage), the frequency of contamination is high due to the 40% unaccounted WEEE gap (widespread improper disposal).
