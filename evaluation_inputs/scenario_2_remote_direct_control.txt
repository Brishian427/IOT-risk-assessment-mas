Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: Remote Direct Control

Scenario Description:
Internet connectivity enables remote commands for heating, locking, and monitoring. Insufficient input validation or weak encryption allows attackers to bypass verification and issue malicious physical commands.

Risk Mechanism:
Physical Actuation & Harassment: Attackers physically alter the home environment (disabling heating, unlocking doors) or use 2-way audio to harass occupants.

Context Data:
- British Gas Hive app transmitted unencrypted data, allowing potential heating schedule manipulation
- A Finland HVAC DDoS attack disabled heating in winter
- A hacker used a compromised Ring camera to speak to an 8-year-old child ('Santa Claus' hack)

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: Is this a common automated attack or does it require targeted hacking skill? 2) IMPACT: Does it pose immediate physical safety risks (freezing/entry) or psychological harm?
