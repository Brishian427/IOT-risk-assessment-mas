Lifecycle Stage: Usage Phase
Risk Category: Lack of Continuous Updates

Scenario Description:
IoT devices rely on embedded firmware but manufacturers often stop providing security patches shortly after sale. Devices remain in active use for years while accumulating known vulnerabilities.

Risk Mechanism:
Security Decay: Devices become permanently vulnerable to known exploits (N-day vulnerabilities) because the firmware is closed-source and cannot be patched by the user.

Context Data:
- Amazon Echo (2nd Gen) and Google Nest devices received no security updates for 2-3 years despite active use
- Smart kitchen devices often have critical misconfigurations (no database passwords) that remain unfixed indefinitely

Task:
Perform a Dual-Factor Risk Assessment. 1) FREQUENCY: How common is it for devices to outlive their support window? 2) IMPACT: What is the risk of having permanently unpatchable devices on a network?
